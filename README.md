### Amazon makes first venture into self-driving car space by investing in Aurora
* What is [Aurora](https://aurora.tech/)?
	* founded by Chris Urmson (Google), Sterling Anderson (Tesla), and Drew Bagnell (Uber)
	* creating and designing both software and hardware for self-driving cars
	* focus is on creating a "full stack" software package that can be added to any car
	* car manufacturers can partner with Aurora to deliver Level 4 autonomy to their customers
* What is [Level 4 autonomy](https://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety)?
	* levels 0-3 require a driver 
	* at level 3, a driver does not have to operate the wheel, but must be able to take control at any timefar away 
	* at level 4, under most conditions the vehicle itself is able to handle all driving functions
	* at level 5, the vehicle is able to handle everything under any circumstance 
		* still very far away from this goal, most self-driving efforts are aimed at level 4
* Amazon's stake in the self-driving industry?
	* as one of the largest stakeholders in transportation, autonomous vehicles or delivery systems could change the game for Amazon, giving the company an even greater competitive advantage
	* makes sense that Amazon is investing in a software creating company like Aurora rather than working with the R&D department of a particular car manufacturer
		* the software being created is intended to be functional on most standard vehicles
